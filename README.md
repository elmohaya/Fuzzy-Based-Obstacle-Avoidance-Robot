# Fuzzy-based Obstacle Avoidance Robot

This project represents a successful attempt to build an obstacle avoidance robot using Fuzyy Logic Theory. It was initially built for a
course project- Intelligent Controllers in the Department of Systems Engineering in KFUPM.

The files in this repository are as following:


- Obstacle Avoidance Report.pdf ------- A full detailed report about the project starting from hardware components, design, assembly, and                                         software algorithms.

- obstacle_avoidance_robot.py --------- This file is the complete code containing all algorithms in the project which was implemented in                                         the Raspberry Pi Microcontroller

- obstacle_robot_data.csv ------------- This is the data file gathered as the robot is in operation mode for further analysis and study

- obstacle_avoidance_robot.fis -------- This is the initial design for the controller using MATLAB fis format

- NN_obstacle_robot.mat --------------- This is the Neural Network Model trained using MATLAB NN-toolbox
